-0.1.1
   - added a chest that stores items in a buffer. the buffer should allow for 'peak limiting' which should further reduce the number of belts in an active state.
   - splitter tries to output 'chest items'/10 items per lane (2 per belt) every 3 ticks.
   - this should allow for better output flow limiting.
   - known issue: since output lanes are limited by chest size for some items.
   - known issue: non-belt/buffer parts of the splitter can be removed without killing the output flow.

-0.3.4
   - added migration script to fix known issue in 0.3.3
      - the script data is rebuilt by searching for all endcaps and attempting to run the detection script
        as if the endcap had just been placed.
      - the force of the buffer piece is pushed to the entities that were migrated from "simple-entity" to
        "simple-entity-with-force"
   - messages relating to a splitter during placement of the endcap relay to the player creating it
   - fixed group-icon/technology-icon image dimensions

-0.3.3
   - removed on-demand event registration for multiplayer compatibility
   - all splitter pieces are now blueprintable. endcap must still be placed last
   - known issue: only pieces placed after 0.3.3 are blueprintable

   - fixed multiplayer join issue

-0.3.1

-0.2.10
   - FIX: the splitter now searches the chest fully when trying to add items to the output belt.

-0.2.9
   - any belt may now be used in a compound splitter
   - FIX: throughput issues on large priority splitters
   - proper migration setup

-0.2.8
   - made compatible with with release 0.14

-0.2.7
   - fixed typo causing unhandled exception at control.lua:338 in certain cases 
   - deconstructing lane/totems/endcap now properly shutdown the splitter

-0.2.6
   - fix for unhandled exception when endcap is placed before buffer (another line 245 bug)
   - new feature: any 1x1 container (including logistic containers) can be used as the buffer piece

-0.2.5
   - fix for error on creating new cs (line 245 bug)

-0.2.4
   - fix for low output issue after 13.3
   - knownissue: lane pieces, totems, and the endcap don't get saved in blueprints

-0.2.3
   - internal release

-0.2.2 
   - forgot change log

-0.2.1
   - Preliminary 0.13 release based on api changes: https://forums.factorio.com/25270
   - Reverted buffer chest changes in 0.1.5 and made a 2nd valid chest. this should prevent items from being deleted when updating.
   - Added tech tree (1 research)

-0.1.5 (unreleased)
   - Buffer chest turned into a smart chest.

-0.1.4
   - FIX: fixed unhandled exception when endcap was placed on splitter with no totems
   - Official recipes made. a 16 lane CS should be about as expensive as a 16-lane belt-based splitter

-0.1.3
   - changed minor configuration info

-0.1.2
   - added icons!
   - performance: added a slow and sleep mode for splitters (9 tick, 120 tick)
   - performance: mod uses no cpu when 0 splitters are active
   - performance: splitters under load use 33% less cpu time

-0.1.1
   - added a chest that stores items in a buffer. the buffer should allow for 'peak limiting' which should further reduce the number of belts in an active state.
   - next.count / (TBD or 8) lanes have items added to output belts
   - this should allow for better output flow limiting.
   - known issue: since output lanes are limited by chest size for some items.
   - known issue: non-belt/buffer parts of the splitter can be removed without killing the output flow.

-0.0.1
   - original
   - round robin and priority balancing
   - known issue: non-belt parts of the splitter can be removed without killing the output flow.
   - known issue: splitter is only created when the endcap is created.
   - known issue: compound splitters ignore belt side when moving items to the output belts.
